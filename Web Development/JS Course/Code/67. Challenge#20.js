/*
Your tasks:
1. Use a constructor function to implement a 'Car'. A car has a 'make' and a
'speed' property. The 'speed' property is the current speed of the car in
km/h
2. Implement an 'accelerate' method that will increase the car's speed by 10,
and log the new speed to the console
3. Implement a 'brake' method that will decrease the car's speed by 5, and log the new speed to the console
4. Create 2 'Car' objects and experiment with calling 'accelerate' and 'brake' multiple times on each of them
Test data:
Â§ Data car 1: 'BMW' going at 120 km/h
Â§ Data car 2: 'Mercedes' going at 95 km/h
GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
